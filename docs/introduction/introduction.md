# Introduction

Kanthor is an open-source Webhook Gateway designed to streamline message delivery management. The system prioritizes delivering the best experience to both developers utilizing the system and the DevOps engineers overseeing its operation.

Kanthor's principles draw heavily from the book **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** which outlines essential characteristics for data-intensive systems:

- Reliability: Tolerating hardware and software faults as well as human errors
- Scalability: Measuring load and performance as well as latency percentiles and throughput
- Maintainability: Operatbility, simplicity and evolvability
